welcome to my profile. <br> 
as a result-driven tech enthusiast and currently a sophomore, i wish to just explore, upskill and gain experiences. i have a
flexible approach to all work situations, and find it easy to adapt. i have keen interest in cyber-security domains such as
malware analysis and cryptography. i have a good sense of humor and a pleasant approach. and most importantly i am a
movie buff.<br>
